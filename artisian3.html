            <h2 style="color:#1f1f14;font-size: 25px;">COCONUT BUTTER QUESTIONS</h2>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COCONUT BUTTER AND<br>COCONUT OIL?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size:15px ;padding-left: 30px;">Coconut Butter is the pureed meat of mature coconuts.  It is roughly 60% oil, but it also has the fiber,<br>
                naturally-occurring sugars, and other nutrients from the meat in it.  It is solid at room temperature (a<br>
                creamy white/beige color) and when warmed up is thick and creamy and smooth.</h3>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">Coconut Oil on the other hand has no fiber. The oil has been separated from the meat of the coconut.<br>
                It is solid at room temperature and translucent. If you see it solid, it may look like it has florets or<br>
                snowflakes in it. When warmed up, it becomes liquid and completely clear.  It can be used for higher<br>
                temperature cooking such as sautéeing or frying.</h3>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">HOW DO YOU USE ARTISANA COCONUT BUTTER?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">Coconut butter can be spread on toast, added to smoothies, curries, cakes, cookies, drizzled over fresh<br>
                fruit or to make Pina Coladas.  You do not want to use it to sautée anything. The solids will scorch.</h3>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">HOW DO YOU USE ARTISANA COCONUT OIL?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">You can use coconut oil the same way you would use a dairy butter or other vegetable oil.  Spread on<br>
                toast, use it to sautée veggies, or use it in place of vegetable oil or shortening when baking.</h3>
            <a href="" style="text-decoration: none;padding-left: 30px;" class="link">Read our post about using our Coconut Oil and our Coconut Butter</a>
            <h2 style="color:#1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">THE COCONUT BUTTER JAR SAYS TO GENTLY WARM THE JAR TO<br>
                MAKE IT SPREADABLE. HOW DO I DO THAT?</h2>
            <h3 style="color:#4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">There are several ways to warm up your jar of coconut butter.  You can partially submerge the jar in<br>
                warm to hot water.  If you have a microwave, you can put it in the microwave for 10 seconds at a time<br>
                (please be aware that the fibers in the coconut butter will scorch very easily).  Or, you can wrap the jar<br>
                in a heating pad and let it melt slowly. You can even leave it in the warm sunshine for the afternoon!<br>
                Stirring will help it soften faster.</h3>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">Whatever option you choose, once the jar is warm all the way thru it will be easily spreadable.<br>
                Depending on the temperature of the room it has been known to stay soft for several days.</h3>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">I JUST BOUGHT SOME COCONUT BUTTER AND I OPENED IT UP AND<br>
            SAW WHITESNOWFLAKES SHAPE ON TOP.IS THIS MOLD?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">Your Coconut Butter is just fine. This is not mold. Coconuts are roughly 60% oil, and that oil likes to<br>
                separate from the fiber in the Coconut Butter. When you first open your Coconut Butter, you may<br>
                find either a complete layer of translucent oil at the top or spots that look like snowflakes or florets.<br>
                You may also see these white spots around the rest of the jar. This is perfectly normal. All you need to<br>
                do is gently warm the jar and stir the oil back into the butter.</h3>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">CAN I USE YOUR COCONUT BUTTER FOR SAUTEEING?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size:15px;padding-left: 30px;">Coconut oil can be used in high heat cooking, but if you heat coconut butter up too much, the solids<br>
                will scorch or burn.</h3>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 25px;">AMAZON SALES QUESTIONS</h2>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">MY PRODUCT ARRIVED DAMAGED AND AMAZON WON'T ALLOW ME<br>
                TO RETURN IT.WHAT SHOULD I DO?</h2>
            <h3 style="color:#4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">Please contact us if you have any issue with the quality or state of an Artisana product you purchased<br>
                on Amazon. You can reach our customer service directly by email at info@artisanaorganics.com, by<br>
                phone at 866-237-8688, or by messaging us via Amazon. Please include any photos possible when<br>
                contacting us about a packaging or quality issue. We will do our best to resolve the issue directly with<br>
                you, or advise on how to successfully reach out to Amazon for resolution. Please also read through our<br>
                re-seller policy below.</h3>
            <h2 style="color:#1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">HOW CAN A CUSTOMER TELL IF AN ITEM SOLD ON AMAZON IS SOLD<br>
            BY AN AUTHORISED RESELLER?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">We stand behind our products with a guarantee/warranty against manufacturer defects. However,<br>
                there is a limitation on the warranty for purchases made on Amazon.com.  With respect to sales on<br>
                Amazon.com, due to the proliferation of counterfeit and grey-market products being sold on<br>
                Amazon.com, we will provide a manufacturer’s warranty only for products purchased directly from the<br>
                seller Artisana Organics (i.e. directly from us via Amazon) or from a reseller who we have confirmed as<br>
                purchasing directly from us and providing genuine, new and authentic U.S. version of Artisana<br>
                Organics brand products. Currently, WishingUWell and iHerb are the only Amazon resellers for which<br>
                the manufacturer’s warranty applies. </h3>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">Always feel free to <a href="" class="link" style="text-decoration: none;">Contact Us</a> if you have a question about an online purchase you've made, or an<br>
                issue you would like resolved.</h3>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">I SAW ARTISANA PRODUCTS FOR SALE IN PLASTIC RECYCLABLE JARS<br>
            ON AMAZON.ARE THOSE REAL?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">Any product purchased from the Amazon seller Artisana Organics is guaranteed to be real. Please see<br>
                the question above for more info on our re-sellers. You may see some of our products now available in<br>
                recyclable plastic, BPA-free jars on Amazon and on Amazon only. We are transitioning all of our<br>
                products in small jars to ecommerce-friendly packaging (i.e. recyclable plastic) for Amazon sales. We<br>
                chose to do this in order to reduce breakage and to reduce Amazon's use of plastic bubble wrap, which<br>
                is far more difficult to recycle or re-use than plastic jars. Please note: our small glass jars will still be<br>
                available for sale <em>everywhere else</em> you are used to purchasing them (including on this website), and you<br>
                will see the plastic jars on Amazon only. Additionally, we are still and will always be selling our products<br>
                gin their larger size in glass jars, on Amazon and everywhere else.</h3>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 25px;">GENERAL PRODUCT QUESTIONS</h2>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">HOW DO YOU USE ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT BUTTERS?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">Anything you can do with a peanut butter you can do with our butters. Make a nut butter sandwich,<br>
                use in cookies, smoothies or even make a peanut-free Pad Thai dressing. Check out our <a href="" class="link" style="text-decoration: none;">Instagram<br>
                 feed</a> and our <a href="" class="link" style="text-decoration: none;">Recipes</a> section for ideas!</h3>
            <h2 style="color:#1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">WHAT MAKE ARTISANA SO AMAZING?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">We are peanut-free, gluten-free, soy-free &amp; dairy-free. We are certified Organic, Kosher, Non-GMO,<br>
                CLEAN and RAW. We do not add any extra oils, sugar, emulsifiers or preservatives to our pure raw<br>
                butters and we take care to use minimal ingredients and processing in our cacao spreads. The amazing<br>
                thing about this is that with no preservatives we are still completely shelf stable. No need for<br>
                refrigeration, even after opening, for up to 18 months.</h3>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">IS IT POSSILBLE THAT YOUR NUTS COOULS HAVE BEEN CROSS<br>
                CONTAMINATED WITH PEANUTS BEFORE YOU RECIEVED THEM?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">We take our statement of being 100% peanut-free very seriously.  All of our nuts and seeds are<br>
                completely free of peanuts...from the source to the jar.</h3>
            <h2 style="color:#1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">WHAT IS THE SELF LIFE YOUR NUT BUTTERS?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">The shelf life of our nut butters is 12 to 18 months from the date of manufacture, depending on the<br>
                item. You should be able to find a "Best By" date printed around the base of the jar, or on a sticker<br>
                applied to the bottom of the jar.</h3>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">SHOULD I REFRIGERATE YOUR NUT BUTTERS AFTER OPENING?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">here is really no need to refrigerate. Our butters are shelf stable. In fact if you chill them too much<br>
                they will not spread easily.</h3>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">HOW DO YOU KEEP YOUR PRODUCTS FROM SPOILING? AFTER<br>
                PUTTING YOUR PRODUCTS IN JARS DO YOU HAVE TO HEAT THE JARS?</h2>
            <h3 style="color:#4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left:30px ;">We do not heat the jars. Right after the product is processed we put it in jars to prevent exposure and<br>
                contamination when it is at its most sensitive point. We do not add anything to prolong the life of the<br>
                product.</h3>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">HOW DO YOU SEAL YOUR LIDS FOR SAFETY?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">The lids are machine tightened and then a safety seal is added that is under the label. The jars are<br>
                unable to be opened without breaking the safety seal. Some people expect to hear a "pop" when a jar<br>
                is opened, as this is common to many other nut butters. However, you will not hear a "pop" on ours,<br>
                because the "pop" comes from a heat-sealing process and we do not use heat to seal our jars.</h3>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">ARTISANA PECAN AND WALNUT BUTTERS ARE BLENDED WITH<br>
                CASHEWS. WHY IS THIS? HOW MUCH OF THE BUTTER IS CASHEWS?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size:15px;padding-left: 30px;">There are a few reasons we put cashews into these two highly acclaimed organic, raw nut butters.<br>
                Cashews make the walnut and pecan butters more creamy and spreadable. Cashews also act as a<br>
                natural sweetener to temper the natural bitterness of the walnut and pecan skins (which we leave in<br>
                for the health benefit). If you look at the ingredient list you'll see that pecans make up the majority of<br>
                ingredients in the Pecan Butter, and walnuts make up the majority of ingredients in the Walnut Butter.</h3>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">HOW ARE YOUR ALMONDS PASTEURIZED?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size:15px;padding-left: 30px;">We use California organic almonds in our Almond Butter and thus our almonds are pasteurized by our<br>
                growers and suppliers. They have found a proprietary process that meets state requirements and keeps<br>
                the temperature low. As soon as the technology becomes available they are planning on transitioning<br>
                over to a cold pasteurization process. We additionally have certified all our butters, including almond<br>
                butter, RAW and CLEAN to ensure that they retain a high bio-availability of nutrients from tree to jar.</h3>

            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">HOW MUCH POTASSIUM IS FOUND IN ALMOND BUTTER?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size:15px;padding-left: 30px;">On average, there are 113 mg (milligrams) of potassium in 16 grams of almonds (1 tablespoon). Keep<br>
                in mind, nutrient content may vary between brands, as many also add oils, sugars, or salts. Artisana<br>
                Almond Butter is 100% organic almonds, with no other added ingredients.</h3>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;font-size: 15px;padding-left: 30px;">We often refer people to the <a href="" class="link" style="text-decoration: none;">USDA'S Food Composition Database</a> to find nutrition facts on various<br>
                food products. Google will also provide you with average nutrient content of various foods.</h3>
            <h2 style="color: #1f1f14;font-size: 20px;">DO YOU HAVE COUPONS?</h2>
            <h3 style="color: #4d4d33;padding-left: 30px;font-size: 15px;">We do not send out paper coupons, but we do occasionally have neat offers and promotions available<br>
                to our fans. The best way to learn about these is to sign up for our email list at the bottom of this<br>
